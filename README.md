Amazon Prime Video Titles EDA
This repository contains an end-to-end data analysis project on the Amazon Prime US movie and TV show catalog. The project demonstrates exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and basic hypothesis testing using Python and Google Colab.

📢 Business Objective
To help Amazon Prime’s content and strategy teams understand their US catalog by identifying trends in content mix, genres, show types, audience ratings, cast/crew, and user engagement—ultimately improving content recommendations and user satisfaction.

🗂️ Dataset
titles.csv: ~9,800 movies and TV shows (columns: id, title, type, release year, genres, age certification, runtime, IMDb/ TMDB ratings, etc.)

credits.csv: Actor and director info for every title.



🛠️ Key Steps
Data understanding: Structure, missing values, duplicates, variable roles.

Data cleaning/wrangling: Handling nulls, formatting lists for genres/countries.

Visualization: 15+ clear plots (distribution, counts, bar, box, heatmap, pairplot, etc.) showing:

Movies vs TV shows count

Genre and country breakdowns

Age certification distribution

Key actor/director frequencies

IMDb and TMDB ratings, trends over time, popularity

Correlation and feature analysis

Statistical/Hypothesis testing: Difference in ratings by type, association between age-certification and show type, score-popularity correlation.

Business storytelling: Actionable insights and remarks for every chart.

Conclusion: What should business do next to improve Prime’s platform offering.

📈 Major Insights
Movies dominate, with Drama and Comedy leading genre counts.
